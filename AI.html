            <h1>AI Introduction</h1>
            <center>Artificial intelligence (AI) is a technology that allows computers to perform tasks that usually require human intelligence. AI uses algorithms, data, and computational power to simulate human thought. 
How does AI work?
AI systems are trained to detect patterns in data and learn from experience. 
AI systems use algorithms to determine how to respond to data. 
AI systems can learn to model complex relationships between inputs and outputs. 
Examples of AI
Optical character recognition (OCR): Uses AI to extract text and data from images and documents 
Voice assistants: Like Siri and Alexa, which use AI technology 
Customer service chatbots: Which help users navigate websites 
Benefits of AI 
Automation of repetitive tasks
More and faster insight from data
Enhanced decision-making
Fewer human errors
24x7 availability
Reduced physical risks
Impact of AI
AI is the backbone of innovation in modern computing. It has serious implications for the business world. </center>
